A demo of live-updating code coverage.

To get setup:

1. `npm install`
2. `npm run watch`
3. `npm run coverage-watch`
4. Visit: [http://localhost:3000/coverage/lcov-report/](http://localhost:3000/coverage/lcov-report/)


If you skip/unskip in/out the test in `src/index_test.js` and save it,
you'll see your browser auto-update with those changes.
